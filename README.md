# Hand-Gesture-Based-sCaptcha
# Introductio
CAPTCHA is a widely used security mechanism to prevent spammers from submitting automated forms. It is a simple test that tells humans and bots apart. Traditional CAPTCHA’s are a combination of distorted text and numbers or an audio with extra noise. The theory is that humans can correctly identify such distorted text while a bot can’t. However, with the advancement in the field of Artificial Intelligence it is only a matter of time that such CAPTCHA’s
will be cracked by bots. These CAPTCHA’s wastes a lot of time and efforts of users.This report aims to explain the creation of a new experimental CAPTCHA that is claimed to provide greater security against spam bots than existing CAPTCHA systems. Report contains a summary of our project. In brief, our project is about using computer vision to detect sign language, specifically numbers 0 to 9 and thus detect numbers that can be used to solve numberbased CAPTCHA puzzles to verify if the user is human or a bot. Using our project, we can provide a 2-layer security to verify users from bots as we use both hand gestures and CAPTCHA based numbers which is very hard to replicate artificially.
# Methodology
n our module, we randomly generate character set and ask the user to show a gesture that corresponds to that character. The user’s gesture is taken and processed to determine if it represents the displayed character. If the gesture is correct, the CAPTCHA is solved, and the user is viewed as a human.A random number is generated by the system and user has to replicate that number using his/her hand gesture, system will capture the image and the region of interest from the image is cropped. This cropped image is then converted into YCbCr format to segment the skin region (hand) from the image. The image is further smoothened with the help of gaussian blurring. To remove unwanted noise in the background by preserving the shape of hand, morphological opening transformations were performed. This pre-processed image is then fed to the train DenseNet121 model to predict the outcome. The predicted outcome of each input is appended to a list and the concatenated string of elements of list are then matched with the string of random generated number. If both these
string matches then it confirms that user is human and not a bot so system will allow user to proceed further. So, basically it differentiates the robot and human and provides a good two layered security.

# Experimental setup
We have experimented with a number of datasets
publicly available. What we observed was that all of the
datasets contained hand signal pictures with no background. At the moment we are still trying to implement
hand gesture recognition with a background although the
model is not very accurate, we plan to improve the accuracy
in near future.
Following are the details of the dataset: -
• Image size: 100 x 100 pixels
• Colour space: RGB
• Number of classes: 10 (Digits: 0-9)
• Number of participants: 218
• Number of samples per participant: 10
# Results
We can summarize by saying that we were able to make a working computer vision model that can detect hand sign number gestures. We can thus say that we have created a working model that can be used to verify human users from bots. Since we use numeric CAPTCHA to verify humans, it can be said that the system has a dual approach for verification. We first use the CAPTCHA so that only humans can read it and protect the system from OCR attacks. Followed by this, the user needs to make hand gestures according to the CAPTCHA code and only after the hand gestures are verified that the human passes the test.
